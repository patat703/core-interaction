Simply Chocolate is a Denmark chocolate brand based in Copenhagen. Its interactive website presents excellent products presentation that makes these chocolate bars look very appetizing and differentiate from other chocolate bars that we can find in groceries. Other than chocolate bar, they also sell other chocolate products such as icelandic liqourice coated with white chocolate, raspberry and acai powder. This product (figure no.2) is displayed with real ingredients (white chocolate and raspberry). Most of their product photographs are taken flat angle. Similarly, this icelandic liqourice, instead of having it taken stood up, is photographed graphically by having it laid down on a solid blue backdrop with the ingredients that appear in shapes to imitate graphic shapes. Although it is a still image, viewer may be able to imagine it being animated.
