    <p>Serge Najjar is a minimalistic Lebanese photographer, who takes an abstract look at the concrete forms, architectural buildings, and the play between natural light and shadow in his hometown, beirut. He uses geometraic shapes, patterns and compositions in his work to provide visual pleasure. He said that he wants people to understand that "it is important to redefine the way they look at their own neighborhood by showing it in a fresh and positive way. Show the unnoticed, the hidden details, the changing lights". He is obsessed with photographing buildings around him since he discrovered the joy of capturing lines and geometry through the camera.</p>

    <p>This photography obsession was initiated from his childhood when he grew up reading a lot of art book and auction catalogues. He was into abstract art and composition in paintings.</p>

    <p>On the whole, Najjar's purpose of his work is for people to understand that is is important to redefine the way they look at their own neighborhood.People may see things boring, but through another perspective the same thing can be viewed interestingly through a creative eye.</p>
