        I am exploring graphic design as photography. Objects are arranged in the scene to create graphics, unlike real-life photography. Designers could consider composition of the objects, color palettes and the messages to bring across. The object could be anything from paper, readymade objects, to food. Their shapes and forms can interestingly mimic shapes of another similar looking objects that can express a humorous sense in the message. The message brings across is often very impactful and clear. I am intrigued by how these artworks can create a futuristic effect or illusion to the eyes. These still-life photography is also extremely useful as a tool for advertisement. I am greatly inspired by a photographer Annabelle Breakey, who works for well known companies such as Starbucks, Kelloggâ€™s, etc.. Not only compositions and layout are significant, but also lighting that enhances the objects.</p>
