      Joel Evey got his popularity as an art director since working in Pixar. He now works for Urban Outfitters in which he created amazing graphics which included different elements like fonts and many graphic techniques. These graphics pieces are hang tag or posters on the wall or type on the window. His works normally include bright colors, more hypercolor, and bold line work.

      “Urban Outfitters have been making some very high quality catalogues for a while now, and it turns out that’s mainly down to Joel Evey being their print art director. A man with his finger in an unreal amount of internet and zine-related pies, Joel has the enviable ability to nonchalantly throw bits of type on to a page and still make it look very, very cool.”</p>
