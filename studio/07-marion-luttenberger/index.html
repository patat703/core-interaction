    The new Subway Visual Identity System was produced by creative agency Turner Duckworth (NYC) and Creative Director Andy Baron, who brought in Austria-based Photographer and Designer Marion Luttenberger to develop and execute the new visual trajectory of the Subway brand.</p>
    <p>
    Marion worked with Argentina-based Food Stylist and Creative Director Anna Keville Joyce to create a fascinating and tasty imagery. This campaign introduces Subway sandwich line highlighting Subway sandwich ingredients.</p>

    Marion Luttengerger's website had inspired me with many sets of works that are so unusual, which is something I do not see anywhere else, and extremely creative. I could sense that there are a lot of story tellings to each work and these concepts are expressed mainly through photography and graphics.</p>
    <p>
    I came across this topic and was interested to look at these imageries not because of myself being a subway-lover but instead remembering how my parents used to open up Subway franchise back home. I remember subway ingredients were never exciting to me until I see this creation visual of the Subway brand. These ingredients are introduced in a playful approach by throwing in bright, bold colors and decorating food with many visual imageries. For example, cheese becomes a book, meatball and onion become mars, cucumbers become glasses, pepper and ham become a dancing figure, and olives say "XOXO". These imageries create enjoyment and humor for viewers.</p>
